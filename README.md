## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the **development mode**.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will **automatically reload** when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the **test runner** in the interactive watch mode. See the Create React App documentation for more information on running tests.

### `npm run build`

**Builds the app for production** to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. **Your app is ready to be deployed!**

### `npm run eject`

> **Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the default build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you **full control** to customize them.
